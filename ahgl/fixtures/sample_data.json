It\u2019s something unique to Starcraft, and it keeps me coming back for more.  It\u2019s also a good competitive outlet.

He was a player that did not really know about Starcraft 1 when Starcraft 2 was released, but it seems that he was convinced of the game very fast from the \"old skool gamers\" that this game is more than a game - something that others would call a religion  He drew on the knowledge of the experienced gamers in our company like a sponge and soon met the point where he did learn enough from each of the gamers in the company that he reached a level where only videos from other experienced users could bring him forward. He made the links between tactics fast and has now grown to a challenging enemy!</p></li>\n  \t\t</ol><li>\n<p>What is your Heart of the Swarm beta character code and ID?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n</li>", "race": "T", "game_profile": null, "team": 28, "active": true, "captain": false, "char_name": "Crashmaker"}}, {"pk": 173, "model": "profiles.teammembership", "fields": {"profile": 189, "champion": "", "char_code": null, "questions_answers": "<ol><li><p>Why did you choose this SC2 race?</p><p>The are the most unique race out of any RTS game I have played.

I am an avid Magic The Gathering player, so I frequently play with friends.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>Why do you play StarCraft?</p><p>It is something that has always been a part of my life. I started playing Starcraft 1 in beta with my dad.  It became a way we could bond.  When my brother got old enough, I began to play with him.  Although having not played the game for years, it was still a part of me.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>How long have you been playing?</p><p>I played Starcraft 1 very very casually for a couple years after it was released.  When Starcraft 2 released, I played through the campaign, then didn't touch the game again for about 9 months or so until I finally picked it back up and learned how to play competitively.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>What have you done to prepare for the momentous challenge that is the AHGL?</p><p>I have started working out.  Lifting weights, running, etc.  I am really not too sure if that will help me when I am actually playing, but it definitely makes me feel less terrible about all the hours I am putting in for practice.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>Who is the best player on your team? Why?</p><p>With this game being so complex, it is almost impossible to pinpoint a best player.  Everyone has learned important things about the game from everyone else.  The replay system in Starcraft 2 has by far been our greatest learning tool.</p></li>\n  \t\t</ol><li>\n<p>What is your Heart of the Swarm beta character code and ID?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n</li>", "race": "Z", "game_profile": null, "team": 24, "active": true, "captain": false, "char_name": "Crispitysnak"}}, {"pk": 617, "model": "profiles.teammembership", "fields": {"profile": 1069, "champion": "", "char_code": null, "questions_answers": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>What do you do for a living?

This puts us at a big advantage because this gives us a bigger pool of people to work with for free gifts and in-game bonuses. Other teams don\u2019t know how to take advantage of this, therefore, they will fall mercilessly to their doom.

A lot. I\u2019m a season ticketholder for the Oakland Athletics and Baltimore Orioles, and I travel coast-to-coast to see both opening days (when they don\u2019t conflict), I love college sports (Stanford Football season ticketholder too!), and I\u2019m a big football fan (NFL Redzone is like crack; Go Ravens!). I also read quite a bit on my nook, and obviously I play a lot of other games other than just legends. Oh, and I'm a Jericholic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why do you play League of Legends?</p>\n<p>Something about DoTA, when I first played it, was incredibly fascinating, and I love team-based games, especially when the team size is limited. I\u2019m attracted to games where teamwork and strategy can be a huge advantage to success. Playing DoTA in premade 5s was incredibly fun, but frankly not challenging unless you were doing inhouses, because you would roll pubbies (or get a lot of ragequitting). If I pubbed I\u2019d inevitably have little-to-no fun, because... well, if you played DoTA I\u2019m sure you know what pubbing is like. Legends offered fixes for so many of the things that the structure of WC3 wouldn\u2019t allow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How long have you been playing?</p>\n<p>I played DoTA for 2-3 years, and I\u2019ve been playing Legends since the summer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What have you done to prepare for the momentous challenge that is the AHGL?</p>\n<p>There was an in-house tournament at Google, and many of the people on my team there are on this team.

Good luck shutting him down.

I've always been competitive and team oriented, so I love the way League of Legends combines the two elements to create such an intense and dynamic experience. I also cannot spend too much time playing games, with my other commitments, so I can get my fix quickly with a game of LoL. Although, if I lose, it's very difficult to resist playing another game just to try to make up for my loss.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>How long have you been playing?</p><p>I've been playing LoL almost since it came out.

It seems like strategies change daily (sometimes hourly) so I have to constantly be on the up and up to make sure I have a chance to win my matches. This constant changing keeps the game from getting stale and is what keeps me coming back for me!</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>How long have you been playing?</p><p>I played SC1 for about 3 years or so, though admittedly I only played NR 15min games.

The problems are hard and require attention to detail - small problems in a critical piece of infrastructure can cause big problems higher up the stack. It's kinda like macro - build pylons, build probes - if you don't get that right then you might as well gg and call it a day.

I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.... Other what?</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>Why do you play StarCraft?</p><p>For fun, of course. Aside from laddering 1v1, I play a lot of 2v2 with my little brother. We used to play Starcraft when we were younger and lived back home. Now he's all grown up living in Oregon and I'm in California, but Starcraft is still a way for us to hang out - even if we can't get together in person. We even both managed to sneak away from real life for a few days to hit MLG Anaheim 2011 together - it was awesome! Hi KillerFlea!</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>How long have you been playing?</p><p>I started way back with WarCraft. The first one :). Then WarCraft II, StarCraft, and Brood War.

I really should be better at this by now.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>What have you done to prepare for the momentous challenge that is the AHGL?</p><p>Every night I steal nerds' ladder points.

The biggest help has to come from my team of fellow Best Buy Starcraft players during our Sunday night Geek Squad Star League games (Streaming live Sundays @ 11 EST <a href=\"http://www.gsstarleague.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gsstarleague.com</a> ) of the game discussion that comes from it. </p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>Who is the best player on your team?

When the SC2 Beta came around, I decided I actually wanted to become decent at the game and started laddering.  I started watching Day[9] and reading TeamLiquid, and made it\nup to Gold.  I stopped playing a few weeks after the release, mainly because of the fact that none of my friends played.

What do you love about your job?</p>\n<p>I\u2019m an SDE at Microsoft (duh) working on the Online Commerce Platform (which is not Bing even though everyone thinks it is!!!). I enjoy the fact that every day I come to work I feel like I have something to accomplish today, and there are lots of smart people I work with who are also here to actually accomplish things. Plus I feel like I have a lot of leeway on how I do my work \u2013 to a high degree I choose what I want to work on, and in what order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What other hobbies do you have?</p>\n<p>I play lots of custom games like Run Ling Run on SC2 (I actually play custom games a lot more than I play 1v1)! In real life I also play Squash, and I\u2019m a huge fan of Big Bang Theory. I used to play chess, but I haven\u2019t really played much since graduating in 2009.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why do you play StarCraft?</p>\n<p>I suppose because I find it a good way to pass the time. I played SC1 for a long time too. I don\u2019t really enjoy 1v1 very much though \u2013 I prefer messing around in UMSes or team games with friends. Grinding 1v1 ladder is soooo boring. I typically only play team games with friends also (although I did play enough random team just to get masters on it to make my profile more attractive \u2013 it\u2019s annoying to try to repeatedly get together a team of four to play 4v4).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How long have you been playing?</p>\n<p>I got a copy of SC2 on the first day of the Beta (I won one of TL\u2019s SC1 tournaments that had it as a prize). I started SC1 about 6 months after it was initially released as I recall and was basically active ever since until the retail release of SC2 (even though I had SC2 beta, I didn\u2019t devote myself to it, and quit the beta for months at a time). I was on a bunch of top non-Korean teams and got pretty involved in the community, including being a moderator on teamliquid. With the release of SC2, I basically re-evaluated my priorities and decided to entirely depart from the SC2 community and focus just on my own personal aspect of gaming. Being heavily involved in the community can be fun, but it ends up eating up a lot of time that these days I simply don\u2019t have in order to give; I prefer these days to spend my SC2 time actually playing team/UMS games, as opposed to dealing with administration issues. I am still a member of TL, and post occasionally, but I haven\u2019t logged into my former moderator account for many months, and I don\u2019t keep contact with any of the people I knew in that phase of my life.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What have you done to prepare for the momentous challenge that is the AHGL Tournament?</p>\n<p>I played the MSFT qualifiers! I didn\u2019t really play much else. I\u2019ll probably play 100 games or so in the couple days leading up to it. For qualification purposes, I looked at the group of people who were in my qualification group and saw they were all in diamond league. I figured they wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with my mechanics if I used an aggressive build that required equivalent level micro/multitasking to stop (whereas if I tried to play a reactive macro game, I was more reliant upon catching/stopping whatever weird &amp; crazy cheeses they may come up with), so I just prepared one all-in per matchup and went 8-0 in games against my group. I played maybe 30 practice games over the course of a week in order to make sure I wasn\u2019t going to do something dumb like supply block myself and lose to a 4 gate . I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s determined who I\u2019ll play in the AHGL so I don\u2019t know if I have time to prepare for a specific opponent. If not, I\u2019ll probably just play a couple dozen practice matches ahead of time. I always did quite well in SC1 when I had a specific opponent to prepare for, but I haven\u2019t really played any tournaments/matches in SC2 due to a lack of interest in that stuff (it\u2019s a lot easier to never show your own skill level and instead just criticize others while being immune to retribution!).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why is your team going to win?</p>\n<p>Presumably I\u2019m supposed to say something here about how we have the best players or the best practice routine or something like that. There\u2019s a Microsoft channel, although I don\u2019t really go there, nor do I go to the weekly LANs (I have my own circle of friends, and we have different priorities than the MSFT channel, which is less focused on team play) Are we going to win? I have no real idea . I\u2019d like to think so, and I\u2019m typically pretty confident in my own play (I don\u2019t suffer from nerves when playing in competitions or LANs \u2013 I found that playing an instrument in high school actually really helped with performance anxiety in StarCraft!). From what I\u2019ve heard most of the other teams don\u2019t even have any/many Masters league players, so if what I heard is true, then we definitely should win\u2026</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Who is the best player on your team? Why?</p>\n<p>Hmm, I think I am, although whether I\u2019d beat everyone on the team if I sat down to play them today is irrelevant . I think I\u2019m the most talented RTS gamer on the team \u2013 I\u2019ll try to practice some even though I hate 1v1 so I don\u2019t let down the team ;[</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whom do you fear most amongst the competition and why?</p>\n<p>I have no idea who else is on the other teams, so no one at this point. There are people in the US who I\u2019d be highly likely to lose to if we played them, but I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re on any of the companies we\u2019re playing against.</p>\n</li>\n</ol><li>\n<p>What is your Heart of the Swarm beta character code and ID?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n</li>", "race": "P", "game_profile": null, "team": 1, "active": true, "captain": false, "char_name": "MegumixBear"}}, {"pk": 396, "model": "profiles.teammembership", "fields": {"profile": 1450, "champion": "", "char_code": null, "questions_answers": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Why did you choose this SC2 race?</p>\n<p>I had been playing as Random until recently. I\u2019d gone through playing all the various races as my main race at various points in time throughout SC2\u2019s lifespan \u2013 basically I\u2019d play one race until I got mad enough about some matchup or aspect of the game, at which point I\u2019d switch to a different race. I decided to take the next logical step and just play all three races as my main race. Eventually, I decided that I disliked ZvP sufficiently (as Zerg) to pick a certain race, and doing so also helps improve quicker. That said, having played random is relatively convenient for helping my teammates practice, as I can easily play whatever matchup they want to work on at a reasonably competent level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What do you do for a living?</p>\n<p>As implied by my title, I am in fact a Software Development Engineer. In practice, that means I do a variety of tasks related to coding. Sometimes I even write code!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What do you love about your job?</p>\n<p>I mostly enjoy having had an issue and then finding a clever resolution for it. It\u2019s a great feeling to have had something that needed to be done, and then finally get it working and finished. While I can respect the effort and ability exhibited by progamers in gaming, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d personally find it as satisfying to not feel like I have specific \u2018larger-scale\u2019 problems that I\u2019m addressing through my own actions. Being a cog in a greater machine isn\u2019t bad the way it can be made to sound :).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What other hobbies do you have?</p>\n<p>I play squash a couple times per week, and I enjoy reading fiction books (no high literature though please :)). I also play quite a few non-melee SC2 custom games like Run Ling Run, Gem TD, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why do you play StarCraft?</p>\n<p>Because I enjoy it? I\u2019d be curious what other potential answer people would give to this question. I enjoy the real-time aspect of it \u2013 I played quite a bit of chess when I was young, and only the bullet/blitz time-control games ever held much interest to me; I guess if it\u2019s not quick paced, I get bored pretty quickly. I always valued mechanical precision back in Starcraft 1, and it\u2019s an important part of SC2 for me too. Even though it may seem inconsistent with the fact that I\u2019ve been a relatively major teamplayer in SC2 compared to my 1v1, I also enjoy the fact that in SC2 you\u2019re not relying as heavily upon other players as in some other genres of games. I dislike voice chatting with people while gaming, and the fact that there\u2019s no need to do that in SC2 (I also refused to voice chat with my teammates in SC2 when doing teamplay) is another plus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How long have you been playing?</p>\n<p>I got the beta the first day it came out as I recall. Until relatively recently I haven\u2019t really played much 1v1 melee though. More recently (like in the last month or so) I\u2019ve started playing more seriously on ladder though. I played SC1 (and then BW) from about 6 months after SC1 came out until SC2 was released retail, but I hadn\u2019t been playing serious melee for the entirety of that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What have you done to prepare for the momentous challenge that is the AHGL?</p>\n<p>Well, primarily I\u2019ve been playing a bunch of ladder, which has helped me improve my play a lot; I also play some games for fun with Microsofties (although the majority of the time I spend with Microsofties is not aimed specifically at improving the way it is when I ladder, as a bunch of it is obbing other people play and having fun). Ladder is good practice for something like this because you see a wide range of ridiculous cheeses and strategies that help you prepare for something like the AHGL \u2013 particularly because I\u2019m disappointed that they apparently haven\u2019t learned from the first season and insisted on going forward with this ridiculous best of 1 garbage. In a best of 1 format, any random things can happen, so it\u2019s important to have had practice with all kinds of things that would make Idra rage. Although I must say, screwing up and losing after a cannon rush from Piqliq is frustrating no matter how much you tell yourself it helps you improve yourself as a player :).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Who is the best player on your team? Why?</p>\n<p>Well, Cowsrule is a bit better than me with his Zergly Zerg on the whole, but I have a pretty good record against him due to the fact that the matchup I play against him in is PvZ :P.</p>\n</li>\n</ol><li>\n<p>What is your Heart of the Swarm beta character code and ID?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n</li>", "race": "P", "game_profile": null, "team": 2, "active": true, "captain": false, "char_name": "MegumixBear"}}, {"pk": 465, "model": "profiles.teammembership", "fields": {"profile": 526, "champion": "Trundle", "char_code": null, "questions_answers": "<ol><li><p>Why did you choose this champion?</p><p>Love jungling, love trolling.

It's just complicated enough that you can make educated decisions without it feeling random (compared to e.g. a game like Supreme Commander).\n\nI never realized it until now, but it looks like I'm actually really competitive. Starcraft is the ultimate challenge of the mind and when you win you really feel like you're \"smarter\" than your opponent. Besides playing Dark Souls I know of no other game that is as fulfilling when you win.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>How long have you been playing?</p><p>Since the beta.

Also not switching races and refining your build orders probably helps a lot.

Playing video games has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. Watching e-sports evolve before my eyes is so emotionally exhilarating for me, it never fails to give me goosebumps when I hear the cheers at all of the major tournaments that have been happening throughout the world. Outside of the virtual world, my attention falls on my beloved car. I love to drive almost as much as I love to play games. I'm starting my savings plan to get the 2013 Shelby GT500 in two or so years.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>Why do you play StarCraft?</p><p>I play StarCraft II because I love the focus and dedication that it requires. I see SC like a virtual, timed game of chess. Mind games, strategy and some quick fingers--there is just so much opportunity to develop skill sets and so many paths to take that it really makes for a superb game. While it can often be mentally draining, it is always rewarding.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>How long have you been playing?</p><p>As I said before, I've been playing SCII since dial-up. I must have started playing the game when I was somewhere between the 3rd and 5th grade, I'm now 23. So, needless to say I have been playing for a while. However, I only got into ladder games when SCII came out, and this thing called life would often put limits on my play time but that hasn't meant I have any less fun!</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>What have you done to prepare for the momentous challenge that is the AHGL?</p><p>Even though I currently don't play as often as I had been during my last year of college, I still watch streams almost every day in order to stay informed on the latest builds. I've also been participating, when possible, in the tournaments that Ian (Polaris) has set up as unofficial Geek Squad events.</p></li>\n  \t\t\t\t\t<li><p>Who is the best player on your team? Why?</p><p>Callmebonjwa, the one I also see as my friendly rival, is the one I would consider to be our best player. I have faced him many times through our Geek Squad tournaments and I have yet to take a series off of him, though I always take off a game. One day I'll take a set off of him, that's a promise :)</p></li>\n  \t\t</ol><li>\n<p>What is your Heart of the Swarm beta character code and ID?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n</li>", "race": "P", "game_profile": null, "team": 20, "active": true, "captain": false, "char_name": "Yakarue"}}, {"pk": 484, "model": "profiles.teammembership", "fields": {"profile": 544, "champion": "Poppy", "char_code": null, "questions_answers": "<ol><li><p>Why did you choose this champion?</p><p>Poppy was one of the first champions I picked up.

Now as why he is my favorite in LoL -- He has an awesome amount of base damage without having to gear for it in his abilities. His dash makes clearing minion waves a breeze. On top of that, harassing champions and then using decoy immediately after makes it so much fun [especially seeing them waste an ability on it].
